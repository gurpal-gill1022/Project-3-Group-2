# Project-3-Group-2

# The purpose of the project is to help people who are new to sports and are trying to get more information about which were the best years in Sports for the five major sports (NBA, NHL, NFL, MLB, MLS). The information will be learnt by using a chosen dataset, clean it, visualize the finding and analyse it in order to gain the information across the years of 1958-2018.

# The overll all project was accomplished by cleaning the CSV file which we acquired that held the information about these five major sports, using Jupyter notebook then importing the CSV into MongoDB database. After that step, we used Flask to connect MOngoDB database (local database) to the HTML. Finally, we used Chat.js as the Java Script library to create the charts for the data analysis and visualization.
